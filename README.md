# WORK IN PROGRESS
This project connects an Arduino device with a simple HC-05 Bluetooth module connected. This creates a socket which is used by a Python program which sends a BT command each time an element of the interface is modified. This UI uses PyQT to create a Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) to control this Arduino device
